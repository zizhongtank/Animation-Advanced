What went right/wrong
Actually, in my original idea, there were only three elements I had designed: population, trash, and urban environment sanitation index. My initial plan was to make the three parties mutually influence each other. In other words, there is an arithmetic formula between every two elements. I set an initial value for each of the three elements. For example, the population is 10000, the trash is 1000, and the index is 0. This ensures that these three elements are balanced under their respective algorithms, which is the so-called initial state. Then I set two buttons to add or subtract the element population. When the value of the population element changes, the values of the other two elements will also automatically change according to their own operational publicity, so as to achieve the effect of automatic change of the three values.
